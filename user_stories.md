##### The goal of BusMall
BusMall takes a unique approach to doing a marketing analysis on products that consumers have an interest in buying. The goal is to feature only items that consumers are willing to purchase. 

##### Marketing analysis
Create a user friendly site that the user may have easy access to view and click on the products. Displaying a clean graph with the total clicks per item.

##### Guidelines of user and developer
###### User
1. As a user, I want to see three images that will appear, and I may click on the one I like. 
2. As a user, I want to look at a graph that will display information regarding the click per image. 
3. As a user, I want easy accessibility to the products if I wish to purchase them. 

###### Developer
1. As a developer, I want the user to have a clean site that will present three images and log the click of one of three images. 
2. As a developer, after 25 selections  I want to turn off event listener on the images and display the total clicks.
3. As a developer, I want to display a graph with the total clicks on images because the consumer will have a better understanding of visuals.
